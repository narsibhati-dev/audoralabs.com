Downtime is expensive. A few minutes of an API or website being down can mean lost revenue, broken integrations, and frustrated users. Yet many teams still rely on monitoring tools that are either overpriced for what they need, clunky to configure, or built for enterprises with huge budgets. We built **Better Uptime** to offer a modern, straightforward way to monitor your APIs and web services—with fast checks, smart alerting, and status pages your customers can actually trust.

## The problem with uptime monitoring today

Existing solutions often fall into two camps. On one side, you have legacy platforms with complex pricing, long contracts, and dashboards that feel stuck in the past. On the other, you have minimal “is it up?” checkers that don’t give you sub-minute resolution, flexible alerting, or proper status pages. When something breaks, you want to know quickly, get the right people notified, and show your users a clear status—without jumping through hoops or paying for features you don’t use.

We wanted monitoring that’s **fast**, **configurable**, and **transparent**: quick to set up, accurate enough to catch real issues, and ready to communicate status to the people who depend on your services.

## What is Better Uptime?

Better Uptime is an uptime monitoring and alerting system built for APIs, websites, and other services. We focus on **sub-minute check intervals** so you catch outages quickly, **intelligent alerting** with customizable escalation so the right person gets notified, and **beautiful status pages** so you can communicate clearly with customers and stakeholders. Integrations with Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, and webhooks tie everything into the tools your team already uses.

## Key features

- **Sub-minute monitoring** — We check your endpoints at intervals that matter, so you’re not waiting five or ten minutes to discover something is down.

- **Intelligent alerting and escalation** — Define who gets notified, when, and how. Customize escalation policies so critical issues don’t get lost in noise.

- **Status pages** — Public or shared status pages that look professional and stay in sync with your monitors, so customers and partners see accurate, up-to-date information.

- **Integrations** — Connect to Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, and generic webhooks so alerts land where your team already works.

- **Historical uptime and SLA reporting** — Track uptime over time and report on SLAs without exporting to spreadsheets or third-party tools.

## Who it's for

Better Uptime is for **DevOps teams**, **SREs**, and **developers** who run APIs, websites, or other services and need reliable monitoring without enterprise bloat. If you’re tired of paying for unused seats, fighting with outdated UIs, or wishing your status page didn’t look like an afterthought, Better Uptime is built for you.

## Built for speed and reliability

Under the hood, Better Uptime uses **Go** for high-performance checks and workers, **Redis** for low-latency state and rate limiting, **Webhooks** for flexible integrations, **PostgreSQL** for configuration and history, and **React** for the dashboard and status pages. We chose this stack to keep checks fast, alerting reliable, and the product easy to operate at scale.

## What's next

Better Uptime is in active development. We’re focused on nailing core monitoring and alerting, then expanding status page customization, more integrations, and deeper SLA and reporting features. If you’re looking for a modern alternative to legacy uptime tools, we’d love to have you in the loop.

Stay tuned for updates—we’re building the monitoring experience we always wanted for our own services.
